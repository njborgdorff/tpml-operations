# TPML Operations Dashboard — Summary for Approval

**Prepared for:** Nick Borgdorff, Business Owner
**Date:** January 31, 2025
**Status:** Approved (with enhancement)

---

## What We're Building

A command center for running your AI-staffed organization. You'll be able to:

1. **Create projects by describing business needs** — Answer questions like "What problem does this solve?" and "Who are the users?" The AI team runs the complete planning workflow (PM creates backlog and sprints, CTO creates architecture) and returns a clear summary for your approval. Upon approval, all project artifacts are generated automatically.

2. **See everything at a glance** — One screen showing all active projects, their status, which sprint they're in, and what decisions are waiting for you.

3. **Conduct sprint reviews** — After each sprint, have a conversation with your AI team to ask questions and give direction, plus receive a written status document.

## Proposed Sprint Plan

| Sprint | Duration | What You'll Have |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** | 2 weeks | Create a project, get an AI-generated plan, approve it. The core workflow works. |
| **Sprint 2** | 2 weeks | Dashboard showing all projects, status, pending decisions. Your single view of everything. |
| **Sprint 3** | 2 weeks | Sprint debrief conversations and written status documents. Full review workflow. |

**Total timeline:** 6 weeks to full feature set.

## What You'll See After Sprint 1

- A project intake form where you answer business questions (no technical fields)
- Submit the form, wait about a minute while the AI team works:
  - AI PM creates sprint breakdown, MVP definition, and prioritized backlog
  - AI CTO creates technical architecture (hidden from you unless you ask)
- Receive a one-page summary telling you what will be built, how long, and what decisions you need to make
- Approve, request changes, or reject
- **Upon approval:** The system generates all project artifacts automatically (BACKLOG.md, architecture docs, handoffs) — the same workflow we just did manually

This proves the concept: **you describe the need, the AI team runs the full planning workflow, you approve, and all documentation exists.**

---

## Business Decisions Needed Before Starting

**None.** The AI team will make all technical decisions autonomously per your requirements. You'll only be asked to approve the final plan for each project you create.

---

## What This Won't Include (Yet)

- Multi-user access (single user for now — you)
- Automatic file generation in the codebase (future)
- QuickBooks integration (future)
- Email notifications (future)

These can be added in later sprints if needed.

---

## Your Next Step

**Approve this plan** and the CTO will begin technical architecture. You'll next hear from us when Sprint 1 is ready for review.

Or **request revision** if something doesn't match your expectations.

*This summary was prepared by the PM role. Technical planning will begin upon approval.*
