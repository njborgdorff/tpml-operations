# Required Package Dependencies

The following packages need to be installed for the toast functionality:

```bash
npm install @radix-ui/react-toast
npm install class-variance-authority
npm install clsx
npm install tailwind-merge
```

These dependencies are needed for:
- `@radix-ui/react-toast`: Toast UI primitive components
- `class-variance-authority`: For button and toast variants
- `clsx` & `tailwind-merge`: For className utility functions

Make sure these are added to your package.json dependencies.
